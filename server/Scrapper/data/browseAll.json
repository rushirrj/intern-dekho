Consumers today have a new set of expectations. They want outcomes, not ownership. Customization, not generalization. Constant improvement, not planned obsolescence.\nIn the old world (let’s call it the Product Economy) it was all about things. Acquiring new customers, shipping commodities, billing for one-time transactions. But in today’s new era, it’s all about relationships. More and more customers are becoming subscribers because subscription experiences built around services meet consumers’ needs better than the static offerings or a single product.\nOur vision is “The World Subscribed” where one day every company will be a part of the Subscription Economy® (a phrase coined by our CEO, Tien Tzuo, and author of the best-selling book Subscribed).\nAs consumers wave goodbye to ownership, join us as we help companies win on their journey to usership!\nTHE TEAM\nModern finance leaders are looking for new ways to strategically advise their business and ultimately scale revenue growth. But as they adopt increasingly complex pricing models incorporating a mix of subscriptions, one-time, and usage-based offers, their financial close process has become more resource-intensive, prone to human error, and can span weeks.\nWith Zuora Revenue, businesses can not only automatically recognize, reconcile, and analyze revenue in real-time, but they can accurately close the books as early as Day 0, while easily forecasting their revenue targets.\nYou read more about it at https://www.zuora.com/products/revenue/\nTHE OPPORTUNITY (AKA: Why you want this role over any other out there) \nWe are looking for a Sr Engineer who is self-motivated to design, develop, test, and operate cutting-edge, large scalable, and enterprise SaaS applications.\nOur Tech Stack: Java, Spring, Rest API, Microservices, Kafka, AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, Apache Pinot, AngularJS, Oracle, PL/SQL, Jenkins\nWhat You’ll Achieve\nEnable scrum teams to be successful by designing & building DevOps tools and CI/CD pipelines to meet the delivery and quality commitmentsPlan, design and implement the right tooling for the operation of large scale enterprise SaaS applicationsHelp the team achieve the bold goal of every commit reaching production post quality gates.Help with Zuora’s transition to micro-service and cloud-based architecture.Raise the bar on engineering practices and code quality.\nWhat You’ll Need To Be Successful\nBTech/BE/BS/MS/PHD in Computer Engineering discipline or relevant degree. 10+ years of experience specializing in Dev/ops for enterprise SaaS products Self-starter who is able to make a large impact with minimal supervision.Proficiency with AWS Services including Lambda, EC2, ECS, EMR, S3, Cloudwatch.Strong in scripting languages such as Python, Groovy etcHands-on experience with build engineering tools such as Gitlab, Jenkins, docker, chef, or similar (Ability to learn new tools)Hands-on experience with modern container orchestration services such as K8’s/ ECS etc.Knowledge of Oracle, and PL/SQL will be an advantageExcellent Problem Solving and communication skills.\nWhat are the benefits of working at Zuora?\nEmployee Stock Purchase PlanMedical Coverage and Parental Leave Carrer cash to keep yourself updatedRefresh/wellness holidays along with standard time offOur campus includes a game area along with a well-stocked pantry\nAbout Zuora & Our “zeo” Culture\nZuora (NYSE: ZUO) Zuora provides the leading cloud-based subscription management platform that functions as a system of record for subscription businesses across all industries.
